Irrational Numbers ). Groups of numbers expected are natural, whole numbers, prime numbers, even, odd, integers rational, irrational, composite numbers. A factor is a number that goes into another number without leaving a remainder. From the activity, all possible arrangements of equal groups of any number give the factors of the number (1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20 are factors of 20). A multiple is a number into which another number goes without leaving a remainder. From the activity, 20 is a multiple of 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20. Every number is both a factor and multiple of itself. Listing method involves (a) HCF: listing all the factors of the given numbers and picking the highest of the factors common to the numbers. (b)LCM: listing as many multiples of the given number and picking the lowest common multiple. Prime factorisation involves expressing a given number as products of its prime factors. (a) To find HCF using prime factorisation, express the given numbers as a product of prime factors. Multiply the lowest powers of common prime factor to get the HCF. The HCF of 12 and 18: 12 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 2^2 \u00d7 3, 18 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 = 2 \u00d7 3^2, HCF = 2^1 x 3^1 = 6. (b) To find LCM using prime factorisation, express the given numbers as a product of prime factors. Multiply the highest powers of all prime factors to get the LCM. The HCF of 12 and 20: 12 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 2^2 \u00d7 3, 20 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 = 2^2 \u00d7 5, LCM = 2^2 \u00d7 3^1 \u00d7 5^1 = 30. HCF is used for finding the largest equal division or shared factor between things (dividing resources, scheduling overlapping events, and Time Management, Building Projects (Like Fencing), ...). LCM is useful when finding smallest common interval or multiple when events with different cycles need to align or match, (purchasing items in bulk, coordinating schedules, Finding Common Time Intervals, Planning Work Cycles, Working with Timetables...).",

                    "short_notes": "The four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are crucial when working with integers. In this section we shall explore the relevance of integers to our daily lives. We will explore, how operations on integers can be useful in areas such as calculating temperatures, managing finances, and measuring changes in various contexts. If integer tiles are used, they will act as a visual representation of addition and subtracting. Example: (+5) + (0) = (+5). We can add any number of pairs of negative and positive tiles but they will equal zero and still give us the number we started with. Ensure that the activity selected allows learners to explore and practice the addition and subtraction operation and discover the following generalizations: a. (-2) + (-4) can be expressed as - 2 -4 b. (-2) - (-4) can be expressed as - 2 + 4. Positive integer + Positive integer = Positive integer, e.g., +5 + (+3) = +8, 5+3=8. Negative integer + Negative integer = Negative integer, e.g., \u22124 + (\u22123) = -7, -4-3=-7. Positive integer + Negative integer = subtract the numerically smaller number form the numerically bigger number and take the sign of the bigger one. For (Negative < Positive): 7 + (-4) = 3 (since 7 is larger, the result is positive). For (Negative > Positive): -6 + 3 = -3 (since -6 is larger, the result is negative). Any number + 0 = the number itself, e.g., 8+0=8, 0 + (-5) = \u22125. As observed in the activity a negative number is less than a positive number (-13\u00b0C is less than 3\u00b0C). In finding the average winter temperature closest to that of Zambia learners applied subtraction of Integers ( 26 \u2013 (-13)= 39\u00b0C, 26-10=16\u00b0C,...). The smallest difference is the one whose climatic zone is closest to that of Zambia. This activity will allow learners to practice addition of integers with the same sign and different signs - for the initial balance of K150 plus a deposit of K100 give us a new balance K250, (150 + 100 = 250 ...). - After a withdraw of -30, learners will find how much is left in the account by adding integers with different signs (-30 + 250 = 220 ...). When multiplying two integers of the same signs the result should be positive [4 \u00d7 3 = 12, (\u22122) \u00d7 (-5) = 10 ]. When multiplying two integers of the different signs the result should be negative [4 \u00d7 (-3) = (-12), 2\u00d7(-5) = (-10) ]. These conclusions for multiplying integers are the same as those for dividing integers. When dividing two integers of the same signs the result is positive (4\u00f72=2, (\u22122) \u00f7 (-1) = 2. When dividing two integers of the different signs the result is negative 4 \u00f7 (-2) = (-2), (-2) \u00f7 (1) = (-2).",

                    "short_notes": "This sub-topic introduces learners to the fundamental ideas of approximations and their application in real-life contexts. It will focus on significant figures and scientific notation and how these can be useful to our day to day lives. Ensure that the instruments used by each group have different degrees of accuracy. Use locally available materials. Approximate values are used when the exact value of something cannot be found, or it is not important that the value be exact for the exercise. Rounding is one way of approximating a value. By using different instruments with different degrees of accuracy, the learners will be forced to pick one of the two measurements to be used on their poster based on their reasoning (measuring an apple with a digital scale and with a beam balance that is correct to one decimal place may give, digital scal......141. beam balance will give 70.3grams). The selection of one of the two measures to place on the poster v- pproximation. Significant figures are used to express degree of detail (precision) of a measurement. All non-zero digits in a number are significant (3727 has 4 significant figures). Zeros between non-zero digits are always significant in both whole and decimal numbers (105 has 3 significant figures, 1.03 has 3 significant figures, 0.00402 has 3 significant figures). Zeros at the end of a whole number are not significant. Zeros at the end of a decimal number are significant (3.00 has 3 significant figures). Zeros before the first non-zero digit in a decimal are not significant (0.0045 has 2 significant figures). The representation on the calculator is known as Scientific Notation. It is written as: a \u00d7 10^n where. i. a is a number greater or equal to one and less than 10. ii. n is an integer (positive, negative, or zero). iii. 10^n scales the number to its actual magnitude. Steps to follow when expressing in standard form: a) Large Numbers in Standard Form: i. Move the decimal point to the left until you have one nonzero digit to the left of the decimal point. This number becomes a. ii. Count the number of places you moved the decimal point. This becomes the positive exponent (n). iii. Write the number as: a\u00d710^n. b) Smaller numbers in Standard Form: i. Move the decimal point to the right until you have one nonzero digit to the left of the decimal point. This number becomes a. ii. Count the number of places you moved the decimal point. This becomes the negative exponent (n). iii. Write the number as: a\u00d710^-n. Approximating numbers in scientific notation to a given degree of accuracy involves rounding the coefficient (the number before the '\u00d710' '') to the desired number of significant figures or decimal places. Here are the key rules and steps: Consider the number of significant figures needed. Round the coefficient \u2018a' to the specified number of significant figures or decimal places using standard rounding rules (If the digit after the desired precision is 5 or greater, round up. If it is less than 5, round down). If rounding the coefficient changes its magnitude (e.g., from 9.99 to 10.0), adjust the exponent n to maintain the correct value. For example: 9.99\u00d710^3 rounded to 2 significant figures becomes 10\u00d710^3, which is rewritten as 1.0\u00d710^4. Express the number in scientific notation with the rounded coefficient and adjusted exponent( if applicable ).",

In this sub-topic, you will learn about relative error, absolute error, percentage error and tolerance, which are key tools for assessing how close a measurement is to the true value. Estimation helps us make an assumption on various aspects of everyday life (Money to be spent, distance, time taken and water usage c...), especially in situations where the exact measure is not known. For instance, sugar costs K60.99, toothpaste costs K35.44, soap costs K16.23, lotion costs K54.00 and Juice costs K42.49, the total cost of the items which is K209.15 can be estimated as K210.00. From the practical activity 1, we obtained different measurements against the true value (8.4m, 9.6m, ...) the difference between the true value and the measured value is called absolute error. Absolute error = |Measured Value-True value| (8.4m -8.2m=0.2m, ...) in this case our absolute error is 0.2m. Relative error is the ratio of the absolute error of the measurement to the true measurement. (refer to the different measurements that learners have found). Relative Error = Absolute error / True value. Error in measurement may also be expressed as a percent of error. The percent of error is found by multiplying the relative error by 100%. Percentage Error = (Absolute error / True value) \u00d7100%. Tolerance refers to the allowable limit of variation in a measurement, value, or dimension. It defines the range within which a measurement or value is considered acceptable or accurate. One of the ways of expressing Tolerance range is True Value \u00b1 Tolerance value ( for instance 10 cm \u00b1 0.2 cm), where the true value (10 cm) is the target or ideal measurement. The tolerance range (\u00b10.2 cm) specifies how much the actual measurement can deviate from the true value and still be acceptable. Tolerance range = Nominal Value \u00b1 Tolerance Value. Tolerance range can also be expressed using limits, ( lower limit \u2264 l < upper limit where the lower bound = true value \u2013 tolerance value, upper bound = true value + tolerance value and l is the true value ). When the true value is rounded off, the acceptable error can be found by taking half the smallest unit value (8.4cm to one decimal place smallest unit value of 0.1 giving a tolerance range of 8.4\u00b10.05 cm) The smallest unit value of: i. 5cm is 1 ii. 5.3 km is 0.1 iii. 10.234litres is 0.001. The objective of the activity is to increase learners' awareness of how errors arise during manufacturing process as they compare the measurements of the model to those on their design.",

We will also look at how to represent these combined operations using Venn diagrams. All these aspects shall be explored in real-life contexts. From the activity learners will notice that the members in the category are sets with items called elements which are well defined (same characteristics) and distinct (not repeated).For instance, a set of Natural numbers from 1 up to 7 maybe {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, a group of vowels could be {a, e, i, o, u}, names of the villages maybe named as {Kasese, Mwangu, Fendi,...}. A set is denoted with a capital letter (A, B, ...) and elements enclosed using curly brackets or braces {} for instance, V= {a, e, i, o, u}. The order of elements in that group or collection may not be important. From the activity: Roster form or listing set of shoe sizes can be (S = {1, 2, 3, 4,,...}or S= {34,35,36, ...}, V= {Kasese, Mwangu, Fendi,...}). Set-builder notation form, since the shoe sizes are recorded using a set of numbers which belong to Natural numbers, thus maybe: {x | x is a Natural number less than 5} or {x| x<5, x\u2208N}. (Numerical elements). Number line: ({x | x is a Whole number less than 5} or {x| x<5, x\u2208N}. (Numerical elements ). A Venn diagram will provide visual representation of the universal set aswell as subcategories and their intersection. (descriptive and Numerical). Sets without any intersection are disjoint sets. The learners reflect on their learning through discussions. Drawing a Venn diagram with i. actual elements will show a point at the beginning of each number. ii. number of elements will not show a point at the beginning of each number. The intersection of sets is the set of all elements which are common to the given sets. From the activity above, the list of the common hobbies in each pair is the intersection ( \u2229) set. This is written as A \u2229B where A is a set of Ann's hobbies and B is a set of Boyd's hobbies and \u2229 is the symbol for intersection. The union (U) of sets is the set of all elements which belong to the sets under consideration. From the activity, the list of all the hobbies for a pair is the Union set. The complement of a set is the set of elements that are in one set but not in the other set. From the activity above, the list of hobbies that are one partners list and are not part of the other partners list is the compliment. Given a set A its compliment is A^c. (All the hobbies,... form the universal (E) set). The sets to be shed should: i. be created by the learners themselves ii. include some combined operations iii. must have operations for upto 3 sets .( A\u2229 (BUC) ).",
