Introduces subtraction of fractions, highlighting that the process is similar to addition (finding LCM, converting to equivalent fractions, then subtracting numerators). Demonstrates 2-3 examples of subtraction on the chalkboard. Then, introduces simple real-life word problems involving both addition and subtraction of fractions. Guides learners on how to interpret the problems, identify the operation required, and solve them systematically. Emphasises showing all working steps.",
      "learner_activity": "Learners participate in the review and actively engage with the new concept of subtracting fractions. They work through examples, asking clarifying questions. Learners attempt to solve real-life word problems, sharing their strategies and solutions with the class. They ensure neatness and clear presentation of their working.",
