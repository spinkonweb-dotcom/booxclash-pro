Think mathematically and accurately in problem solving skills and apply these skills to formulate and solve mathematical and other related problems. Produce imaginative and creative work from mathematical concepts and ideas. Develop abilities and ideas drawn from mathematics to reason logically, communicate mathematically, and learn independently without too much supervision (self-discipline). Development positive attitudes towards mathematics and use it in other subjects such as science and technology. Apply mathematical tools such as information and communication technology in the learning of other subjects. Use mathematics for enjoyment and pleasure. Develop understanding of algebra, geometry, measurements and shapes.",
