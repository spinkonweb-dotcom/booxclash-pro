    "philosophy": "The syllabus aims at providing, through well designed studies of experimental and practical science, a worthwhile educational experience for all the pupils taking the course, whether or not they go on to study science beyond secondary School level, thereby, contributing to pupils’ general education by using the impact of known applications of science concepts and principles on society. This is intended to enable pupils acquire adequate understanding and knowledge. The syllabus has been reviewed in line with the Outcome Based Education principles which seek to link education to real life experiences that give learners skills to access, criticize, analyse and practically apply knowledge that help them gain life skills. Effective implementation of Outcome Based Education requires that the following principles be observed: clarity of focus, Reflective designing, setting high expectations for all learners and appropriate opportunities.",
