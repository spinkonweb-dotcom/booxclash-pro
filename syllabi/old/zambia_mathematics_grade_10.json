    "philosophy": "Quality, lifelong education for all which is accessible, inclusive and relevant to individual, national and global needs and value systems. Mathematics is an important tool for the development and improvement of a person's intellectual competence in logical reasoning, spatial visualization, analysis and abstract thought. When learners have acquired enough knowledge in mathematics they develop numeracy, reasoning, thinking skill and problem solving skills. Mathematics is very important not only in science and technology that is vital for the development of the country but also in everyday life and workplace. Mathematics would equip the learner to live in modern age of Science and technology and enable the learner to contribute to the social and economic development of the country and the world at large. Mathematics plays a vital role in the development of highly skilled and technologically based manpower. Mathematics also prepares and enhances the learners' prospect of employment and further education as it also plays a key role as a tool for other learning areas and subject. Mathematics relates to all subjects and provides necessary mathematical pre-requisites for further education. Other subjects in science and technology heavily depend on mathematics concepts. In order for Zambia to comfortably reach the 2010 millennium goals there has to be a deliberate emphasis on mathematics education. Mathematics can also be an interesting subject as it can also be a subject of enjoyment and excitement. This offers learners and students an opportunity for creative work and moments of joy and pleasure. It is very interesting for students and indeed all learners when they discover ideas and insights that would help them pursue mathematics even outside school walls.",
    "competence_learning": "Assimilate necessary mathematical concepts for use in everyday life such as environment and other related disciplines. Thank mathematically and accurately in problem solving skills and apply these skills to formulate and solve mathematical and other related problems. Develop necessary skills needed to apply mathematical concepts and skills in other disciplines. Produce imaginative and creative work from mathematical concepts and ideas. Develop abilities and ideas drawn from mathematics to reason logically, communicate mathematically, and learn independently without too much supervision (self-discipline). Development positive attitudes towards mathematics and use it in other subjects such as science and technology. Apply mathematical tools such as information and communication technology in the learning of other subjects. Use mathematics for enjoyment and pleasure. Develop understanding of algebra, geometry, measurements and shapes.",
