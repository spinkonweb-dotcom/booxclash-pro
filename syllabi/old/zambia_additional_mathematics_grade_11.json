Its competences and general outcomes are the expected outcomes to be attained by the leaners through the acquisition of knowledge, skills, techniques and values which are very important for the total development of the individual and the nation as a whole.",
    "competence_learning": "Assimilate necessary mathematical concepts for use in everyday life such as environment and other related disciplines.\nThink mathematically and accurately in problem solving skills and apply these skills to formulate and solve mathematical and other related problems.\nProduce imaginative and creative work from mathematical concepts and ideas.\nDevelop abilities and ideas drawn from mathematics to reason logically, communicate mathematically, and learn independently without too much supervision (self-discipline).\nDevelopment positive attitudes towards mathematics and use it in other subjects such as science and technology.\nApply mathematical tools such as information and communication technology in the learning of other subjects.\nUse mathematics for enjoyment and pleasure.\nDevelop understanding of algebra, geometry, measurements and shapes.",
