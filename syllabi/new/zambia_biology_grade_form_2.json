    "philosophy": "The Biology Syllabus is designed for learners pursuing Ordinary Secondary School level in Zambian schools. This is a Competence-Based syllabus which emphasises what the learners are expected to do as opposed to what they are expected to know. Through hands-on activities, learners will generate knowledge and life-long learning skills. The course will provide an engaging and explorative journey designed to spark curiosity, nurture foundational skills, and instill love for learning in the young minds. In this course, there is a recognition that the learners are not empty vessels that have to be loaded with knowledge but come with prerequisites and prior knowledge. Therefore, the methods used in teaching them must take into consideration the fact that they have immense potential to create a dynamic and stimulating environment where they can joyfully discover the wonders of Biology. From the moment they begin to explore and discover the world around them, they engage in processes of observation, questioning, and experimentation. The syllabus aims to harness and tap into these innate abilities to provide a solid foundation for further studies in Biology related education and smooth transition to Advanced level Education.",

    "goals": [
      "Instill curiosity to nurture a sense of wonder by encouraging learners to be inquisitive, explore their surroundings, and make connections between the natural world and the biological concepts.",
      "Build a foundation for biological thinking through interactive activities and play.",
      "Introduce fundamental biological concepts such as patterns, measurement, sorting, manipulation, ordering and basic experiments. These experiences act as the future."
