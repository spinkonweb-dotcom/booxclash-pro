    "philosophy": "Quality, life long education for all which is accessible, inclusive and relevant to individual, national and global needs. The Physics Syllabus for Form 1 to 4 is designed to equip learners with a comprehensive understanding of Physics concepts, fostering a deep appreciation for the role of Physics in everyday life and its applications in various fields. This syllabus aims to develop a solid foundation in Physics and cultivate critical thinking, analytical skills, and problem-solving skills. Subsequently, it will help link Physics concepts to real-world problems and emerging technologies through the engagement of learners in hands-on, hearts-on and minds-on practical activities and simulations to reinforce theoretical understanding. In addition, the syllabus intends to create a stimulating and supportive learning environment where learners can develop a profound understanding of the subject. By fostering curiosity, critical thinking, and practical skills, the syllabus will prepare learners for further education and careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), thereby contributing to their overall intellectual and personal growth. It is hoped that the syllabus will inspire learners to explore the fascinating world of Physics and appreciate its significance in shaping the future. The O-level Physics syllabus covers the introductory part of the fundamental principles and concepts of Physics. This syllabus aims at developing an understanding of the natural world, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills. It provides a solid foundation for further studies in Physics and related subjects. This syllabus is committed to providing an enriching and supportive educational environment where learners can advance a lifelong interest in the subject. By promoting inquiry, curiosity, and a passion for science, the syllabus aims to prepare learners not only for academic success, but also for their future roles as informed and responsible citizens in a scientifically advanced society. It is expected that this Physics syllabus, once implemented successfully, will inspire and empower learners to achieve their full potential, equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate and contribute to the world around them. The syllabus is designed to ensure learners develop a deep understanding of physics principles while equipping them with the practical skills and competencies needed for further education and careers in science. This O-level syllabus incorporates an interdisciplinary approach that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) to develop innovative solutions and critical thinking.",
    "competence_learning": "The effective teaching methodologies in STEM physics include: Conducting experiments: Demonstrate key principles and encourage curiosity among learners. Collaborative learning: Pair learners to work together, promoting peer-to-peer teaching, discussion, and problem-solving. Conceptual learning: Connect science concepts to everyday life, industry, or current events, making learning relevant and meaningful. Differentiated instructions: Tailor teaching to meet diverse learning styles, abilities, and interests of different learners. Feedback and Reflection: Encourage learners to reflect on their learning, providing constructive feedback to guide improvement. Inquiry-based learning: encourage learners to explore, investigate, and discover Physics concepts through hands-on experiments and activities. In Physics the following key competences are the fundamental abilities and qualities that will enable individual leaners to: Manage their own learning and knowledge. Interact with others and solve problems. Contribute to society and the economy. Adapt to change and navigate through emerging issues in the environment.",
