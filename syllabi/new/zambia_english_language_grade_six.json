    "philosophy": "The English Language Syllabus for Upper Primary Schools has been developed to meet the needs of learners in Grade 4 to 6. It is designed to help them develop essential skills in listening, reading, speaking, writing, creating, and reflecting upon increasingly intricate spoken, written, and multimodal texts. The aim is to foster accuracy, fluency, and purpose in communication, aligning with the Competence-Based Curriculum of the 21st Century. Moreover, the syllabus endeavours to instil knowledge, skills, values, and positive attitudes, nurturing children to become productive and beneficial members of both their communities and Zambian society. This syllabus builds upon the foundations laid at Lower Primary level. The content outlined in this syllabus is tailored towards enhancing language skills for effective communication and learning across various subjects. The suggested learning activities are carefully designed to expose learners to linguistic practice, fostering proficiency through consistent engagement. It is envisioned that this syllabus will enrich the learning experience at the Upper Primary School level, making it more meaningful and enjoyable. Its activity-oriented approach is intended to promote engagement and pave the way for a seamless transition into secondary education.",
    "competence_learning": "The New English Language Syllabus adopts a Competence-Based Approach, emphasising the practical skills learners will acquire rather than mere knowledge. Specifically designed to build upon the literacy skills developed in Lower Primary Grades (1-3), the Upper Primary English syllabus covers Grade 4 to 6. English Language teaching at Upper Primary level seeks to develop critical thinking skills, among others. At this level, learners are encouraged to analyse and interpret texts, make connections between ideas, and form opinions based on evidence. The focus of this Syllabus is the attainment of basic communication proficiency in real life situations, and development of language as a tool for learning content subjects. As learners progress through their education, proficiency in English becomes increasingly important. Learning of English Language opens doors to higher education opportunities and future career prospects.",
