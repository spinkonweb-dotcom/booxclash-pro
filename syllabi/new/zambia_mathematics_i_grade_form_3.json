    "philosophy": "The Ordinary Level Mathematics I Syllabus is a comprehensive framework designed to equip learners with foundational Mathematical competences, fostering critical and analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and conceptual understanding. It prioritizes competence-based learning, emphasizing mastery of essential skills over content coverage, and aims to empower learners to engage meaningfully with mathematical concepts in real-world scenarios, cultivating a lifelong appreciation for mathematics. The syllabus is flexible and adaptable to diverse learning needs, promoting an inclusive learning environment and preparing learners for academic success and future roles as informed, responsible citizens in a scientifically advanced society.",
    "competence_learning": "Mathematical competence is the ability to develop and apply mathematical thinking to solve a range of problems in everyday situations. It involves the ability and willingness to use Mathematical modes of thought (logical and spatial thinking) and presentation (formulas, models, constructions, graphs, charts). This competence is developed step-by-step over a period of instruction after learning a set of specific competencies.",
    "goals": [
      "To provide quality, lifelong education in mathematics that is accessible, inclusive and relevant to individual, national and global needs and value systems.",
      "To provide an enriching and supportive educational environment where learners can develop a lifelong interest for Mathematics.",
      "To prepare learners not only for academic success but also for their future roles as informed and responsible citizens in a scientifically advanced society.",
      "To ensure learners develop a deep understanding of Mathematical concepts while also acquiring practical skills and competencies needed for further education and careers in Mathematics.",
      "To equip learners with essential skills and knowledge in numeracy, problem-solving, critical thinking, and logical reasoning."
