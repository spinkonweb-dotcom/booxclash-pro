    "competence_learning": "The English Language Syllabus for Ordinary Level (O-Level) Secondary School has been developed to meet the needs of learners in Form 1-4. It is designed to help them develop essential skills in listening, reading, speaking, writing, creating, and reflecting upon increasingly intricate spoken, written, and multimodal texts. The aim is to foster accuracy, fluency, and purpose in communication, aligning with the Competence-Based Curriculum of the 21st Century. Moreover, the syllabus endeavours to instil knowledge, skills, values, and positive attitudes, nurturing children to become productive and beneficial members of both their communities and Zambian society. This syllabus builds upon the foundation laid at Primary School, ensuring a seamless transition into O-Level Secondary Education. It is interconnected with the curriculum offered at lower levels, facilitating continuity and progression. The content outlined in this syllabus is tailored towards enhancing language skills for effective communication and learning across various subjects. The suggested learning activities are carefully designed to immerse learners in linguistic practice, fostering proficiency through consistent engagement. It is envisioned that this syllabus will enrich the learning experience at the O-Level Secondary, making it more meaningful and enjoyable. Its activity-oriented approach is intended to promote engagement and pave the way for a seamless transition into tertiary education and the job market. The teaching of English language will follow the Communicative language teaching methodology. This methodology prioritises both the rules of grammar and the rules governing the appropriate use of language in different contexts. It focuses on all four language skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing. Maximum learner participation through communicative activities is key. The goal of teaching language is to develop communicative competence in learners. Teaching English Language using the Communicative Language Teaching Method should consider all four dimensions namely; grammatical competence, sociolinguistic competence, discourse competence, and strategic competence. Considering that the Communicative Language Teaching Method embraces aspects of the Situational Method and the Cognitive Code Approach, teachers are advised to be Eclectic in their teaching in order to respond to the various learning needs of learners as well as different teaching and learning contexts.",
