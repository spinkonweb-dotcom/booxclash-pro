Learners manipulate different materials and respond to a variety of sensory experiences. The learners' creative work expresses their feelings and perception of the world. The work produced may not mean anything to an adult but may mean a lot to the child. Therefore, the effort that a child puts in an activity should be appreciated and commended. This is the appropriate age because, learners delight in exploring their surroundings by making, dismantling, examining and experimenting things. This is the main thrust of the learning area because it provides an opportunity for learners to use available materials.",
