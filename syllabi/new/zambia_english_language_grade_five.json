It aims to foster accuracy, fluency, and purpose in communication, aligning with the Competence-Based Curriculum of the 21st Century. It instils knowledge, skills, values, and positive attitudes, nurturing children to become productive and beneficial members of their communities and Zambian society. The syllabus adopts a Competence-Based Approach, emphasising practical skills and critical thinking, building upon Lower Primary literacy. It focuses on attaining basic communication proficiency in real-life situations and developing language as a tool for learning content subjects, opening doors to higher education and future career prospects.",
    "competence_learning": "The syllabus adopts a Competence-Based Approach, emphasising the practical skills learners will acquire rather than mere knowledge. It seeks to develop critical thinking skills, encouraging learners to analyse and interpret texts, make connections between ideas, and form opinions based on evidence. The methodology focuses on Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) and Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT), prioritising real-life communication and practical application through meaningful language tasks and role-play. It also promotes independent and collaborative reading for comprehension and love of reading.",
