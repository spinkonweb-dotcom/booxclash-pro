    "philosophy": "The Lower Primary Mathematics and Science Syllabus is designed for Grades 1 to 3, focusing on foundational concepts from Early Childhood Education (ECE). Mathematics and Science are two interconnected disciplines that shape our understanding of the world around us. Mathematics provides the language and tools to describe and analyse scientific phenomena, while science provides the context and application for mathematical concepts. It emphasises learners demonstrating competences fostering 21st-century skills like communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving. This syllabus prescribes mathematics and science as a single learning area and teaching of Mathematics and Science should be integrated. The course recognises individual potential and creates a dynamic environment for discovering Mathematics and Science.",
    "competence_learning": "This syllabus aims to enhance children's innate ability to learn scientific and mathematical concepts through engaging, effective learning experiences. It fosters curiosity through observation, questioning, and experimentation, preparing them for a smooth transition to Upper Primary Education and a solid foundation for STEM education.",
