    "philosophy": "The New English Language Syllabus adopts a Competence-Based Approach, emphasising the practical skills learners will acquire rather than mere knowledge. It is designed to build upon lower primary literacy skills, aiming to develop critical thinking, text analysis, and evidence-based opinion formation. The syllabus focuses on attaining basic communication proficiency in real-life situations and developing English as a tool for learning content subjects, opening doors to higher education and future career prospects.",
    "competence_learning": "The English Language Syllabus provides a holistic development of language skills, encompassing Listening and Speaking, Reading, Writing, and Structure, with each component featuring topics, specific competences, learning activities, and expected standards. The methodology employs a multifaceted approach, specifically Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) and Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT), prioritizing real-life communication and practical application. Role-play provides diverse communication contexts, while reading lessons emphasize independent and collaborative reading for comprehension and fostering a love for reading.",
    "goals": [
      "Develop essential skills in listening, reading, speaking, writing, creating, and reflecting upon increasingly intricate spoken, written, and multimodal texts.",
      "Foster accuracy, fluency, and purpose in communication, aligning with the Competence-Based Curriculum of the 21st Century.",
      "Instil knowledge, skills, values, and positive attitudes, nurturing children to become productive and beneficial members of their communities and Zambian society.",
      "Build upon foundations laid at Lower Primary level to enhance language skills.",
      "Enhance language skills for effective communication and learning across various subjects.",
      "Expose learners to linguistic practice, fostering proficiency through consistent engagement.",
      "Develop critical thinking skills, including analysing and interpreting texts, making connections between ideas, and forming opinions based on evidence.",
      "Attain basic communication proficiency in real-life situations and develop language as a tool for learning content subjects.",
      "Enrich the learning experience at the Upper Primary School level, making it more meaningful and enjoyable.",
      "Promote engagement and pave the way for a seamless transition into secondary education through an activity-oriented approach."
