    "philosophy": "The English Language Syllabus for Lower Primary (Grades 1-3) is designed to help learners consolidate and develop the four language skills of Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing introduced at Early Childhood Education level. This sound knowledge will then be applied to developing the skills of blending known sounds together, reading and identifying known sounds in words and spelling. This enables learners to begin reading at an early stage of their schooling. Handwriting, using the Marion Richardson style (Print in Grade 1, tailed in 2, transitioning to cursive writing in Grade 3 term 1), has been enhanced. It will be taught from Grade 1 – 3, emphasising the concept of print, letter formation, sizing, spacing, consistency, alignment and the correct use of punctuation.",
    "competence_learning": "This syllabus is divided into three components: Listening and Speaking, Reading and Writing. Each of these components include a range of topics and corresponding sub-topics. To ensure a uniform and cohesive delivery of content, specific competences and their corresponding learning activities have been identified to facilitate effective learning. Additionally, a clear expected standard of performance serves as a benchmark for the desired level of proficiency and achievement. This structured approach ensures a consistent and organised learning experience for all learners at this level.",
