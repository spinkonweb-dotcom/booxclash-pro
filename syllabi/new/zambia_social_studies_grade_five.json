    "philosophy": "Education is a vehicle through which a morally democratic learner should be developed. Thus, Social Studies is expected to be the mirror through which Zambian society should see itself in its quest and dedication to promote and perpetuate its social skills, beliefs, values, and traditions. Social Studies is a learning area that covers a number of aspects that include human behaviour, relationships, institutions, and resources. The learning area enables learners to use the acquired knowledge and skills to enable greater understanding of themselves, others, societies, institutions, nations, and environments.",
    "competence_learning": "This new curriculum emphasises that the learner should be at the centre of the education process. Therefore, it is envisioned that the learners should acquire essential competences; and think reflectively, logically, scientifically, creatively and critically so as to promote the formation of positive social behaviour and a socially desirable attitude. It is desired that the learner should have an education that will shape the development of a personally held set of civic, moral, and spiritual values as well as further the acquisition of knowledge and understanding of Zambia's democratic and cultural institutions.",

      "Quality, life long education for all which is accessible, inclusive and relevant to individual, national and global needs and value systems",
