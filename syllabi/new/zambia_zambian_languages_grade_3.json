    "philosophy": "The focus of teaching Literacy and Language in Zambian Languages from Grade 1 to 3 is to develop the learners’ basic reading and writing skills as well as to enhance their listening and speaking skills. Although the components are presented separately in this syllabus, teachers are required to integrate them at lesson delivery. This entails that at preparation stage the syllabus should be broken down into schemes of work and weekly forecast which will contain these components – listening and speaking, reading, vocabulary, comprehension and writing.",
    "competence_learning": "The teaching of Literacy and Language will follow Constructivist principles, where the teacher provides learners with experiences that allow them to hypothesise, predict, manipulate objects, pose questions, research, investigate, imagine, and invent. It will make use of systematic synthetic phonics, which involves the explicit teaching of the following key literacy skills; phonological and phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, reading, comprehension and writing skills. Generally, lesson delivery should follow the Gradual Release Model (GRM). Key competences include Analytical Thinking, Communication, Creativity And Innovation, Collaboration, Critical Thinking, Digital Literacy, Emotional Intelligence, Entrepreneurship, and Problem Solving.",

      "To develop the learners’ basic reading and writing skills.",
      "To enhance their listening and speaking skills.",
      "To prepare learners for learning at subsequent levels."
