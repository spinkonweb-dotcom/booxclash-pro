    "philosophy": "Quality, life long education for all which is accessible, inclusive and relevant to individual, national and global needs. The English Language Syllabus for Ordinary Level (O-Level) Secondary School has been developed to meet the needs of learners in Form 1-4. It is designed to help them develop essential skills in listening, reading, speaking, writing, creating, and reflecting upon increasingly intricate spoken, written, and multimodal texts. The aim is to foster accuracy, fluency, and purpose in communication, aligning with the Competence-Based Curriculum of the 21st Century. Moreover, the syllabus endeavours to instil knowledge, skills, values, and positive attitudes, nurturing children to become productive and beneficial members of both their communities and Zambian society. This syllabus builds upon the foundation laid at Primary School, ensuring a seamless transition into O-Level Secondary Education. It is interconnected with the curriculum offered at lower levels, facilitating continuity and progression. The content outlined in this syllabus is tailored towards enhancing language skills for effective communication and learning across various subjects. The suggested learning activities are carefully designed to immerse learners in linguistic practice, fostering proficiency through consistent engagement.",
    "competence_learning": "This Syllabus intends to develop the learners’ communicative competence in English Language including other skills of listening and speaking, reading and writing. Teachers are; therefore, encouraged to use methods that can improve the learners’ ability to use English Language accurately and appropriately. The methods should further foster the learners’ creativity, imagination, and problem solving thereby prepare them for real life situations, academic pursuits, and career opportunities.",
