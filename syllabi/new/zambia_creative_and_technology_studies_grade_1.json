    "philosophy": "Creative and Technology Studies (CTS) is an interdisciplinary field that combines creativity, technology and innovation to develop practical solutions. Hence this CTS Syllabus is a combination of Expressive Arts, Home Economics and Hospitality (HEH), Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Technology Studies. The learning area also includes some aspects of Social Studies and Cross -cutting issues such as financial education, entrepreneurship, environmental health and pollution management. This integration has been necessitated in order to provide learners with a unique experience of appreciating the concepts that the various learning areas endeavor to provide. This syllabus will help learners to apply critical thinking and creativity in order to meet various societal needs. The CTS syllabus provides a platform on which learners acquire background knowledge on the various subject disciplines that learners will have to do at higher grade levels. It places emphasis on the development of practical skills and enhancement of talents, creativity, self expression and sense of aesthetic. With this in mind, it is important that the subject is introduced to learners at a tender age. This is the best time because at this age, learners have delight in exploring their surroundings; enjoy making, dismantling, examining and experimenting. The main thrust of this learning area is to provide an opportunity for learners to use available materials, put their capability to work and to develop products that meet their real needs and wants.",
