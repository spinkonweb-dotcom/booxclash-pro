    "philosophy": "The Home Economics and Hospitality Syllabus has been developed by the need to provide a national curriculum for Zambia aligned with the competence-based curriculum and 21st Century Skills. It aims to impart the knowledge, skills, values, and positive attitudes that enable children to live and grow into productive and useful members of their communities and the Zambian society. This syllabus comprises of five components namely; Food and Nutrition, Hospitality Management, Health Education, Travel and Tourism, and Needlework and Crafts. The content/topics provided in this syllabus are aimed at facilitating the holistic development of children's creativity, initiative, problem-solving, physical, mental, and emotional skills among others. The suggested activities are designed to offer children hands-on experiences through the manipulation of real objects, interaction with nature, and learning through practice. Thus, the children will develop knowledge, desirable lifelong skills, values, and positive attitudes needed for their personal and national development.",
    "competence_learning": "Cross-cutting themes and emerging issues such as Life Skills, Entrepreneurship, Climate Change, and Financial Education have been incorporated into the syllabus to ensure that children cultivate a mind-set, skills, values, and positive attitudes that prepare them for sustainability and suitability in the labour market. It is envisaged that the syllabus will make learning at this level more meaningful and enjoyable as it is highly activity oriented and allows for a smooth transition at the primary school level. HEH has a direct relevance to the present and future life of every young person. Its purpose is to equip young people in certain important skills for living as individuals and of establishing and developing a stable environment for the nation and their families. It encompasses studies of many of the processes which are necessary for day to day living, particularly within the household and hospitality establishments. It is an interdisciplinary field of study which endeavors to equip learners with knowledge, practical and social skills, attitudes that are essential for success in a global society. The program seeks to equip learners with life skills that will help the recipient to cope with changes in a technological, socio-economical, and multi-cultural society. HEH incorporates the components of Food and Nutrition, Hospitality and Tourism Management, Health Education, Needlework, and Crafts. New concepts of Hospitality, Travel and Tourism, Gender, Human Rights, Pollution, Entrepreneurship, and HIV and AIDS have been included. Learners engage in problem solving situations which require the application of knowledge and the use of practical skills. These situations take into account such factors as basic needs, lifestyles, financial resources, health, environment, and their effects on the individual, family, and society. HEH inculcates positive attitudes towards cost effectiveness in the utilization of local and indigenous resources. It also looks closely at the use of other resources. The subject teaches learners to be self-reliant, business minded and health conscious. These challenges promote the well-being of the individual, family and the society.",
