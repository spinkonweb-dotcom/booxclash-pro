    "philosophy": "The focus of teaching Literacy and Language in Zambian Languages from Grade 1 to 3 is to develop the learners’ basic reading and writing skills as well as to enhance their listening and speaking skills. These components will enhance the development of listening, speaking, reading and writing skills. The competences acquired at this level will prepare learners for learning at subsequent levels. Although the components are presented separately in this syllabus, teachers are required to integrate them at lesson delivery. This entails that at preparation stage the syllabus should be broken down into schemes of work and weekly forecast which will contain these components – listening and speaking, reading, vocabulary, comprehension and writing. The teaching of Literacy and Language will follow Constructivist principles, where the teacher provides learners with experiences that allow them to hypothesise, predict, manipulate objects, pose questions, research, investigate, imagine, and invent. It will make use of systematic synthetic phonics, which involves the explicit teaching of key literacy skills: phonological and phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, reading, comprehension and writing skills. In synthetic phonics, learners are taught letter sounds that they blend to be able to read as opposed to analytic phonics where learners are taught to recognise whole words by sight, and later to break down the word into the smaller units. Generally, lesson delivery should follow the Gradual Release Model (GRM), where the teacher starts by demonstrating the activity, then doing the activity with the learners and finally learners doing the activity independently. Furthermore, a variety of teaching techniques should be employed in order to meet different learning needs of learners.",
