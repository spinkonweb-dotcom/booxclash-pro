    "philosophy": "The main focus of teaching Pre-Literacy and Language in Zambian Languages is to develop the learners' oral language. However, other foundational skills in reading and writing will also be taught. This syllabus has been developed to ensure consistent exposure to and practice of language, thereby helping learners become fluent and successful in academics as they progress to Grade 1 and beyond. The Syllabus is divided into two sections namely; Section A and Section B. Section A presents content for Nursery Level (3-4 years) whereas Section B contains content for Reception Level (4-5 years).",
    "competence_learning": "STRUCTURE OF THE SYLLABUS: The first section of this syllabus covers Nursery Level (3-4 years) while the second section covers Reception Level (4-5 years). In terms of content, this syllabus has the following components: • Listening and Speaking • Pre-reading and • Pre-writing These components will enhance the development of listening, speaking, pre-reading and pre-writing skills. Each component has specific competences that are to be achieved. The competences acquired at the level of ECE will prepare learners for learning at subsequent levels. Although the components are presented separately in this syllabus, teachers are required to integrate them at lesson delivery. This entails that at preparation stage the syllabus should be broken down into schemes of work and weekly forecast which will contain these components - listening and speaking, pre- reading and pre- writing. SUGGESTED TEACHING METHODOLOGY The teaching of Pre-Literacy and Language will follow the recommended approach of teaching key literacy skills which include phonological and phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, listening comprehension, pre-reading and pre-writing skills. Generally, lesson delivery should follow the Gradual Release Model (GRM), where the teacher starts by demonstrating the activity, then doing the activity with the learners and finally learners doing the activity independently (I do, we do, you do). Furthermore, a variety of teaching techniques should be employed in order to meet different learning needs of learners. LETTER SOUNDS AND SIMPLE WORDS The teaching of letter sounds at ECE level has been restricted to sounds represented by single letters in a particular Zambian Language. Sounds represented by more than one letter will be introduced at Grade 1. This syllabus has also provided the sequence to be followed when introducing letters (see appendix 1). The introduction of each letter sound should be preceded by phonological and phonemic awareness. Each letter sound should be taught for two weeks. The teaching of phonological and phonemic awareness is restricted to simple ORAL words formed by Vowel-Consonant-Vowel (VCV) and Consonant- Vowel-Consonant-Vowel (CVCV) structure. ASSESSMENT At Early Childhood Education level, assessment is an integral part of the whole teaching and learning process. In ensuring that the developmental milestones are achieved by the learners, assessment in Zambian Languages will be done through observation and participation. This will include the four language skills, (listening, speaking, reading and writing). However, teachers are not limited to these but are encouraged to assess the learners through different modes as deemed necessary. Through assessment, teachers will be able to know each learner's ability and weakness and provide scaffolding where necessary. KEY COMPETENCES TO BE DEVELOPED: Analytical Thinking: Analyse stories, Comprehend and interpret pictures, Imitate sounds, Demonstrate understanding that speech is made up of sounds. Citizenship: Show understanding of rules. Communication: Use appropriate language in different situations, Demonstrate good listening, speaking, reading and writing skills, Interpret messages represented by signs and symbols, Express oneself clearly and effectively, Take turns in conversing with others, Exhibit awareness of print, Demonstrate ability to comprehend given information. Critical Thinking: Manipulate different objects, Recognise and name items in the environment, Recognise and demonstrate understanding of letter-sound relationship. Digital Literacy: Demonstrate simple hand-eye coordination with digital devices. Emotional Intelligence: Recognise and express emotions. Collaboration: Work with others to accomplish tasks.",
