    "philosophy": "Quality, lifelong education for all which is accessible, inclusive and relevant to individual, national and global needs and value systems. This syllabus is committed to providing an enriching and supportive educational environment where learners can develop a lifelong interest for Mathematics. By promoting inquiry, curiosity, and a passion for Mathematics, we aim to prepare learners not only for academic success but also for their future roles as informed and responsible citizens in a scientifically advanced society. It is designed to ensure learners develop a deep understanding of Mathematical concepts while also acquiring practical skills and competencies needed for further education and careers in Mathematics.",
    "competence_learning": "The syllabus is crafted with a firm commitment to competence-based education, recognizing the importance of not just acquiring knowledge, but rather the development of critical and analytical thinking, problem-solving skills and conceptual understanding. Mathematical competence is the ability to develop and apply mathematical thinking to solve a range of problems in everyday situations, involving logical and spatial thinking and various forms of presentation (formulas, models, constructions, graphs, charts). A specific competence refers to a particular skill, value, or knowledge and attitude that enables learners to perform a specific mathematical task, solve a particular type of problem, or demonstrate understanding of a distinct mathematical concept, achieved after performing several learning activities.",
    "goals": [
      "Develop essential skills and knowledge in numeracy, problem-solving, critical thinking, and logical reasoning.",
      "Serve as a foundation for more advanced Mathematical studies.",
      "Enable the application of mathematical principles in practical scenarios and informed decision-making.",
      "Teach learners to analyze problems, break them down, and develop systematic approaches to solutions.",
      "Help learners develop critical thinking skills, analytical reasoning, and the ability to evaluate information logically.",
      "Equip learners with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate and contribute to the world.",
      "Foster a lifelong appreciation for the beauty and utility of mathematics."
