    "philosophy": "Quality, life long education for all which is accessible, inclusive and relevant to individual, national and global needs",
    "competence_learning": "The effective teaching methodologies in STEM physics include: Conducting experiments: Demonstrate key principles and encourage curiosity among learners. Collaborative learning: Pair learners to work together, promoting peer-to-peer teaching, discussion, and problem-solving. Conceptual learning: Connect science concepts to everyday life, industry, or current events, making learning relevant and meaningful. Differentiated instructions: Tailor teaching to meet diverse learning styles, abilities, and interests of different learners. Feedback and Reflection: Encourage learners to reflect on their learning, providing constructive feedback to guide improvement. Inquiry-based learning: encourage learners to explore, investigate, and discover Physics concepts through hands-on experiments and activities. Integration of Technology: Use digital tools, simulations, and visualisations to enhance engagement, understanding, and analysis. Problem-based learning: Present real-world problems or case studies, requiring students to apply Physics principles to develop solutions. Project-based learning: Assign open-ended projects, allowing learners to design, conduct, and present research or applications of Physics concepts. By implementing these methodologies, a teacher can create an engaging, inclusive, and effective STEM Physics learning environment. In Physics the following key competences are the fundamental abilities and qualities that will enable individual leaners to: Manage their own learning and knowledge, Interact with others and solve problems, Contribute to society and the economy, Adapt to change and navigate through emerging issues in the environment.",
