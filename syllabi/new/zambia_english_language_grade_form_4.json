This methodology prioritises both the rules of grammar and the rules governing the appropriate use of language in different contexts. It focuses on all four language skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing. Maximum learner participation through communicative activities is key. The goal of teaching language is to develop communicative competence in learners. Teaching English Language using the Communicative Language Teaching Method should consider all four dimensions namely; grammatical competence, sociolinguistic competence, discourse competence, and strategic competence.",
