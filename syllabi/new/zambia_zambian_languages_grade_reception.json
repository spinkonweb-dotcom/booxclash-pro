    "philosophy": "The main focus of teaching Pre-Literacy and Language in Zambian Languages is to develop the learners' oral language. However, other foundational skills in reading and writing will also be taught. This syllabus has been developed to ensure consistent exposure to and practice of language, thereby helping learners become fluent and successful in academics as they progress to Grade 1 and beyond.",
    "competence_learning": "The first section of this syllabus covers Nursery Level (3-4 years) while the second section covers Reception Level (4-5 years). In terms of content, this syllabus has the following components: Listening and Speaking, Pre-reading and Pre-writing. These components will enhance the development of listening, speaking, pre-reading and pre-writing skills. Each component has specific competences that are to be achieved. The competences acquired at the level of ECE will prepare learners for learning at subsequent levels.",
