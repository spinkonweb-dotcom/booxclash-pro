    "philosophy": "Contrary to the widely accepted perception, History is much more than just teaching about early creatures, wars, empires and famous events. History provides us with the data that is used to create laws, or theories about various aspects of society. The study of history is a non-negotiable aspect of better citizenship. People that push for citizenship history want to promote a strong national identity and even national loyalty through the teaching of lessons of individual and collective success. There is need to realign the teaching of History in Secondary Schools with the aspirations of society. Studying History at secondary level also lays a strong base for venturing into other branches of academia. It is against this back-drop that the 2024 History Syllabus has been developed. To produce young people with a critical mindset – capable of debating, examining and interpreting national and global issues in the light of past events. Ultimately, we will have a citizenly that will be able to provide well-informed solutions to today's world including the attainment of what is espoused in a number of international instruments to which Zambia is a signatory. When individuals understand the significance of their nation's past, they are more likely to participate in its future. History equips individuals with the tools they need to contribute to the development of their nation in meaningful ways.",
    "competence_learning": "This syllabus allows for learners to not only acquire knowledge but also apply the (knowledge) skills, values, and attitudes to solve situations they encounter in everyday life. Further, the syllabus emphasises what learners are expected to do rather than mainly focusing on what they are expected to know. At the beginning of each form level (1, 2, 3 and 4), there are competencies and descriptors to be developed by the learners.",
