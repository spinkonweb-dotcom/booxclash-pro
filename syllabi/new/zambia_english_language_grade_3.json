    "philosophy": "The English Language Syllabus for Lower Primary (Grades 1-3) is designed to help learners consolidate and develop the four language skills of Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing introduced at Early Childhood Education level. Learners will be taught sounds of English systematically, including short and long vowels, consonants, digraphs, trigraphs, consonant blends, diphthongs, and triphthongs. This sound knowledge will then be applied to developing the skills of blending known sounds together, reading and identifying known sounds in words and spelling. This enables learners to begin reading at an early stage of their schooling. Handwriting, using the Marion Richardson style (Print in Grade 1, tailed in 2, transitioning to cursive writing in Grade 3 term 1), has been enhanced. It will be taught from Grade 1 – 3, emphasising the concept of print, letter formation, sizing, spacing, consistency, alignment and the correct use of punctuation.",
